# ADIONA
AT&amp;T Women in Tech Hackathon Project

What's the problem?

People, especially young women, do not feel safe walking around at night. 
Crimes like rape and harassment are not reported until AFTER they happen, and often times, police have a hard time finding a lead to solve the case.

What's our solution?

We created Adiona, a mobile application that ensures safe commutes for its users. After creating an account, the user sees three buttons: yellow, orange, and red. If nervous, the user clicks the yellow button, allowing police to track her real-time movement on an administrative display that’s only accessible with the proper certifications. If feeling more nervous, the user clicks the orange button, which sends her message of distress and location to those on her emergency contact list (customizable). If in a life-threatening situation, the user clicks the red button, which calls 911 and sends help to her location. There’s a map button that allows the user to see locations of past crimes, so that he/she can make smart decisions as they commute.
